I had no idea what would happen at the end, but when it came it felt at once satisfying, inevitable and mysterious. <a class=\"u-underline\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/duncan-macmillan\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">Duncan Macmillan</a>, its adapter, had dusted out the parlour, stripped the brown carpets of baggy exposition and transposed Ibsen&rsquo;s big ideas into something accessible to the modern ear. &ldquo;This is what happens when the general public becomes engaged with politics,&rdquo; says the conservative Governor Kroll. &ldquo;They get duped into voting against their own interests. They&rsquo;d be better off leaving it to the people who know what they&rsquo;re talking about.&rdquo; Our audiences audibly gasp in recognition of the arguments and ideas that are all too familiar in today&rsquo;s political climate. These are told entirely through passionate, personal relationships. The integrity of Ibsen&rsquo;s story and its themes remain potent, its metaphors vivid and chilling. Lucy Briers, my co-star, does wear a bum roll, however. Personal choice.</p>\r\n<p>Firstly, for clarity, it&rsquo;s Ros-mers-home, which translates as, well, Rosmer&rsquo;s home. In our version it is the eve of a general election and there are many undecided voters. Kroll visits the great house of John Rosmer, former pastor of the town. As a man of influence and power, Rosmer can swing this election &ndash; and Kroll, his brother-in-law, is counting on him.</p>\r\n<p>What Kroll doesn&rsquo;t know is that Rosmer is undergoing a crisis. He has expunged his faith, his background, his beliefs. He now wants to use his privilege to help free society from the corrupt political elite and the dead hand of the church. But in doing so, he has been left with a vast, existential hole. What can he fill it with? If God is dead, who can Rosmer turn to? Himself? Who&rsquo;s that then? He is both lost and highly suggestible. Underpinning this is the insurmountable wall of grief he is battling after the suicide of his wife &ndash; Kroll&rsquo;s sister Beth &ndash; a year earlier. The riddle of her death still holds the living captive.</p>','2019-05-27 21:19:38'),(42,'Femi Elufowoju Jr: Why did Tennessee Williams marginalise African Americans?','femi-elufowoju-jr-why-did-tennessee-williams-marginalise-african-americans','<p>The director takes about hearing The Glass Menagerie differently &ndash; and recalls the day he realised he had to do more than act</p>','<p>His career has spanned more than three decades, but <a class=\"u-underline\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Femi_Elufowoju_Jr.\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">Femi Elufowoju Jr</a> has never been as busy as he is now. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never had the opportunity to direct two shows back to back for the same building,&rdquo; says the director.

Having put Lewis Hamilton on the medium tyres, the team principal, Toto Wolff, admitted the British driver had saved their race in bringing his car home and preventing <a class=\"u-underline\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/max-verstappen\" data-link-name=\"auto-linked-tag\" data-component=\"auto-linked-tag\">Max Verstappen</a> having a chance to pass. It was welcome for giving the race a tense climax that would otherwise have been lacking. Hamilton was vocal about his concerns throughout, which have been criticised but are the understandable complaining of a driver in a pressure situation he could do nothing about. But perhaps what was most telling was just what type of team Mercedes are, as illustrated afterwards. The chief strategist, James Vowles, said with wry humour he hoped for a hug from Hamilton after the race. Hamilton duly burst into the engineers&rsquo; room and proceeded to spray Vowles with champagne. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s for fucking giving me medium fucking tyres for 68 laps,&rdquo; he said, laughing, before they did indeed hug.

He and Sebastian Vettel continue to talk up their chances but their qualifying blunder with Charles Leclerc suggested a harsher reality. Their miscalculation was an operational mistake but it had been prompted by their desire to save a set of tyres, as Binotto admitted because they now had to take chances to catch Mercedes. &ldquo;We are facing a situation where we need to catch up points in the championship,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We need to catch up compared to our competitors and when you need to catch up you need to take some risks as well.&rdquo; Such measures in round six suggest they know the title is already gone.</p>','2019-05-28 23:18:58'),(47,'Cheap and cheerful: why thereâ€™s more to Primarkâ€™s success than you thought','cheap-and-cheerful-why-there-s-more-to-primark-s-success-than-you-thought','<p>While Debenhams and LK Bennett go to the wall, sales are up at Britain&rsquo;s most popular fashion retailer.

I wish it had been there for me</p>','<p>Playing sport at school, especially if you&rsquo;re good at it, can be a brilliant escape from the drudgery of academia. But to be a girl who is interested in sport, it turns out, is less of a teamwork-building break from the classroom and more of a battle. According to Girlguiding, which is about to launch a campaign to make more school sports available to girls, only 43% of schoolgirls are offered the same sporting options as boys. Rugby, football and cricket tend only to be offered to boys, while girls tend to get dance, gymnastics and netball.</p>\r\n<p>Being one of just three girls to take PE as a Scottish Standard Grade (GCSE) in my school year meant that, even if I did want to play football, there were never enough girls to make up a team. And playing with the boys? Well, it simply wasn&rsquo;t allowed. Even if I had forced my way on to the pitch, I doubt the ball would have been passed to me.</p>\r\n<p>There is a lot of work to be done in changing the perception of certain &ldquo;masculine&rdquo; sports such as football and rugby. We need to make sure girls feel able to pursue what they are interested in, without being made fun of for doing so and without teachers just assuming a lack of interest. In particular, teachers need to support girls to carry on with sports beyond the age of 14, which is when girls start to drop out of sports at <a class=\"u-underline\" title=\"\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p06jcpqz\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">one-and-a-half times the rate boys do</a>.</p>\r\n<p>All sports would benefit from being less gendered. I loved the grace and elegance of dance and gymnastics when I did it in PE, but always felt a faint pang of jealousy watching the boys trudging in from 30 minutes of muddy glory on the pitch, while we suffered carpet burns from doing forward rolls on ripped-up old mats. I imagine some of the boys would probably have much preferred to have been indoors with us, too.</p>\r\n<p>The good news is that women&rsquo;s football has seen a significant injection of cash ahead of the Women&rsquo;s World Cup in Paris this June.
